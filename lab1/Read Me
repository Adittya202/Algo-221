Learning Outcome of this Lab:
- Understand the basics of Online Judge platforms.
- Become familiar with standard Input/Output (I/O) formats used in
Online judge
- Learn about common judge verdicts, including Accepted (AC), Wrong
Answer (WA), Time Limit Exceeded (TLE), and Runtime Error (RE).
- For a 1-second time limit, most OJs allow approximately 108
operations.
- For python select PyPy over Python if available, as PyPy is
faster. However, PyPy consumes more memory than Python.
- Review O(n sorting algorithms which have already been covered in

2
)

the previous courses such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and
Insertion Sort.
- Learn to sort with multiple parameter
- Understand the use case of stable sort
- Explore Fast I/O techniques (self-study):
- Python: Using sys.stdin for faster input handling.
- C++: Using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); and
cin.tie(nullptr)
- Java: Using BufferedReader for efficient input reading.
- The fast i/o can reduce program execution time on Online
Judge platforms.
- Fast I/O Example: Python, C++, Java [click Expand to view
