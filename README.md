Learning Outcome of this Lab:
- Understand the basics of Online Judge platforms.
- Become familiar with standard Input/Output (I/O) formats used in
Online judge
- Learn about common judge verdicts, including Accepted (AC), Wrong
Answer (WA), Time Limit Exceeded (TLE), and Runtime Error (RE).
- For a 1-second time limit, most OJs allow approximately 108
operations.
- For python select PyPy over Python if available, as PyPy is
faster. However, PyPy consumes more memory than Python.
- Review O(n sorting algorithms which have already been covered in

2
)

the previous courses such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and
Insertion Sort.
- Learn to sort with multiple parameter
- Understand the use case of stable sort
- Explore Fast I/O techniques (self-study):
- Python: Using sys.stdin for faster input handling.
- C++: Using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); and
cin.tie(nullptr)
- Java: Using BufferedReader for efficient input reading.
- The fast i/o can reduce program execution time on Online
Judge platforms.
- Fast I/O Example: Python, C++, Java [click Expand to view

Deadline: Nov 2, 2025 2:00 PM
No submission can be considered after the deadline ends.

Learning Outcome:
We have already learned about time complexity in theory. Now, we will focus on improving our
naive solution approach. In this lab, we will explore the two-pointer technique. Some problems
that can be solved using the two-pointer approach may also be solvable with searching
techniques. However, our primary focus will be on solving them using the two-pointer method.
Since searching is closely related to the two-pointer technique, this lab also includes a few
problems on binary search.

Understanding Two-Pointer Technique
● Learn how to optimize naive solutions using the two-pointer approach.
● Understand when and why two-pointer techniques are applicable.
● Differentiate between the opposite-direction and same-direction two-pointer
strategies.
Searching

● Review the concepts of lower bound and upper bound and their applications.
● Find out if there is any alternative way to solve the problem you have solved using two-
pointer approach [Self Study]
Performance Analysis
● Compare brute-force, two-pointer, and binary search approaches in terms of time
complexity.

Deadline: Nov 9, 2025 2:00 PM
No submission can be considered after the deadline ends.

Learning Outcome:
In this lab, we will explore the Divide and Conquer paradigm, which is
a fundamental algorithmic technique for solving problems efficiently by
breaking them into smaller subproblems. Through hands-on
problem-solving, students will develop a deeper understanding of
recursion, algorithm design, and optimization.
Understanding the Divide and Conquer Approach
● Learn how to break a problem into smaller independent
subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.
● Understand when and why Divide and Conquer is preferable over
brute-force approaches.
● Apply recurrence relations and the Master Theorem to analyze time
complexity.

Important Notes:
Since the midterm date has been shifted, there is a change in the lab
plan as follows:
● Deadline for Assignment-04 Extended Till: Dec 7, 2025 2:00 PM
● Quiz-04 Date: Dec 6, 2025 , Dec 7, 2025 (as per your routine)
● Quiz-04 Syllabus: Assignment-04 and Assignment-05 (one quiz
covering both topics)
Learning Outcome:
Upon successful completion of this lab, students will have a solid
understanding of graph and grid traversal techniques. They will be able
to apply fundamental concepts such as graph traversal, cycle detection,
shortest path finding, and flood fill in practical problem-solving
scenarios. Students will also learn how similar ideas extend to
two-dimensional grids, enabling them to identify reachable regions and
solve practical search problems. Overall, this lab aims to help
students connect the theory of graph algorithms with their practical

use in code, and to develop confidence in choosing and applying
appropriate traversal strategies.


Learning Outcome:
After completing this lab, students will be able to construct graphs using both adjacency list and
adjacency matrix representations, differentiate between these forms based on their efficiency
and application, and apply suitable data structures to implement and analyze graph-based

No submission can be considered after the deadline ends.

Learning Outcome:
By the end of this lab, students will have a better understanding of
how to use BFS and DFS to solve more advanced problems. They will learn
how to check if a graph is bipartite, how to find a topological order
of a graph, and solve other problems that use these techniques. This
lab will help students think more clearly about how graphs work and how
to turn those ideas into working code.
problems. Students will also be able to interpret problem requirements to design appropriate
graph representations and algorithms effectively.
