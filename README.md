Learning Outcome of this Lab:
- Understand the basics of Online Judge platforms.
- Become familiar with standard Input/Output (I/O) formats used in
Online judge
- Learn about common judge verdicts, including Accepted (AC), Wrong
Answer (WA), Time Limit Exceeded (TLE), and Runtime Error (RE).
- For a 1-second time limit, most OJs allow approximately 108
operations.
- For python select PyPy over Python if available, as PyPy is
faster. However, PyPy consumes more memory than Python.
- Review O(n sorting algorithms which have already been covered in

2
)

the previous courses such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and
Insertion Sort.
- Learn to sort with multiple parameter
- Understand the use case of stable sort
- Explore Fast I/O techniques (self-study):
- Python: Using sys.stdin for faster input handling.
- C++: Using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); and
cin.tie(nullptr)
- Java: Using BufferedReader for efficient input reading.
- The fast i/o can reduce program execution time on Online
Judge platforms.
- Fast I/O Example: Python, C++, Java [click Expand to view

Deadline: Nov 2, 2025 2:00 PM
No submission can be considered after the deadline ends.

Learning Outcome:
We have already learned about time complexity in theory. Now, we will focus on improving our
naive solution approach. In this lab, we will explore the two-pointer technique. Some problems
that can be solved using the two-pointer approach may also be solvable with searching
techniques. However, our primary focus will be on solving them using the two-pointer method.
Since searching is closely related to the two-pointer technique, this lab also includes a few
problems on binary search.

Understanding Two-Pointer Technique
● Learn how to optimize naive solutions using the two-pointer approach.
● Understand when and why two-pointer techniques are applicable.
● Differentiate between the opposite-direction and same-direction two-pointer
strategies.
Searching

● Review the concepts of lower bound and upper bound and their applications.
● Find out if there is any alternative way to solve the problem you have solved using two-
pointer approach [Self Study]
Performance Analysis
● Compare brute-force, two-pointer, and binary search approaches in terms of time
complexity.

Deadline: Nov 9, 2025 2:00 PM
No submission can be considered after the deadline ends.

Learning Outcome:
In this lab, we will explore the Divide and Conquer paradigm, which is
a fundamental algorithmic technique for solving problems efficiently by
breaking them into smaller subproblems. Through hands-on
problem-solving, students will develop a deeper understanding of
recursion, algorithm design, and optimization.
Understanding the Divide and Conquer Approach
● Learn how to break a problem into smaller independent
subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.
● Understand when and why Divide and Conquer is preferable over
brute-force approaches.
● Apply recurrence relations and the Master Theorem to analyze time
complexity.
